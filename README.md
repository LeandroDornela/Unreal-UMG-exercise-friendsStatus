General Description

The objective of this exercise was to implement a user interface to display the connection status of the friends of a player.
The UI appearance received only essential attention, focusing the work on the project architecture using the MVVM pattern.
It consists of two lists, one to show the connected friends and the other for the connected friends, both with a tooltip
showing more player information when hovering over a list entry. Also, a toaster message that pops up when a friend connects.
Connection/Disconnection simulation and test data with initial friends status setup is made by a testing Game Mode.
